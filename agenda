Introduction:
Megatron was a telegram file management bot that helped a lot of users, specially movie channel managers to upload
their files to telegram by just providing a link to it. The project initially started as roanuedhuru_bot which lately
retired and came back as Megatron which was a side project of the
famous Maldivian Telegram community - @Baivaru until it retired.

Agenda:
1. Introduction:
    Setting up [x]
    - common command:
        - on message_ filter for commands - [x]
    - download/Upload:
        - initial portion [x]

3. Media Info:
    - Cross check for video files to add the media info Inline Button [x]
    - Integration of ffprobe to extract media info
        from Video files, basically that also includes creating subprocesses
        to run a shell command [x]

4. Integrating with a DB for global Download/Upload Settings:
    - Attending subscribers comments first [x]
    Note: with the last video we did media info and it was saved to a json file, there was a request to save this file
    to text, well as you remember we had always listen to our community and got things done as always what they wanted,
    lets keep the same spirit.
    - Introducing a DB for the APP to record user settings [x]

5. Updating dld_settings:
    - Edit Reply Markup [x]
    - Updating/Amend documents on Mongo [x]
    - Saving Image Files to DB as base64 [x]


6. Implying dld_settings to upload:
    - Fixing a huge bug I left unattended in last video [x]
    - converting base64 strings/bytes to files [x]
    - define thumbnails on the uploads [x]

7. Moving the callback filters to regex:
    - Bug Fixes 🤷‍ I have no idea what else to call this [x]
    with that lets conclude the video... basically lets take this as a pathway to custom filters which we will
    also do within this project, however I do like these regex filters too, since they are simple and very
    straight forward and easy,.... with that being said have a nice day ahead :-)
